# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
  - ["connecti_lights", "o", {title: "Tap on your lantern and all others will glow to your color wherever they are."}]
  - ["connecti_lights.freq", "i", 5000, {title: "Frequency of PWM"}]
  - ["mqtt.enable", true]
  - ["mqtt.server", "thingsboard.e-yantra.org:1883"]
  - ["mqtt.client_id", "egij2asdas3rn90"]
  - ["mqtt.user", "m4B4ruS9FXkoxaDk1EVe"]
  - ["wifi.sta.enable", true]
  - ["wifi.sta.ssid", "kirito"]
  - ["wifi.sta.pass", "iopzxc29"]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
